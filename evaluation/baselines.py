Identify relevant domains and generate search queries for retrieving papers from those domains that addresses this problem. Your approach should:

1. **Identify Relevant Domains**: Consider which research domains might contain relevant insights or methods for this problem. You may explore connections to other fields if you believe they would be helpful.

2. **Generate Search Queries**: For each domain you identify, provide 3-5 search queries (max 5 words each) that would help find relevant research.

(1) identify the most relevant **coarse-grained domain** (the target domain) that encompasses the input fine-grained domain for the given research problem,

# RESEARCH PROBLEM
{problem_statement}

# FINE-GRAINED SUBFIELD
{fine_grained_domain}

# STEP 1: SUBFIELD IDENTIFICATION (MANDATORY)
First, determine the most relevant **coarse-grained domain** (the target domain which encompasses the subfield, {fine_grained_domain}) that the problem best fits out of the following options (ONLY SELECT THE TARGET DOMAIN FROM THIS LIST):

Computer Science, Medicine, Chemistry, Biology, Materials Science, Physics, Geology, Psychology, Art, History, Geography, Sociology, Business, Political Science, Economics, Philosophy, Mathematics, Engineering, Environmental Science, Agricultural and Food Sciences, Education, Law, Linguistics

Then, all subsequent questions and queries MUST be aligned to the domain and subfields' typical concepts, bottlenecks, and vocabulary.

Examples of "coarse_grained_domain" (illustrative):
- "Probabilistic graphical models" → Computer Science, "Distributed systems" → Computer Science, "Program analysis" → Computer Science, "Human-computer interaction" → Computer Science
- "Gene regulatory networks" → Biology, "Protein folding" → Biology, "Microbial ecology" → Biology
- "Market design" → Economics, "Behavioral decision theory" → Economics, "Causal inference" → Economics

# STEP 2: SEARCH QUERIES (SUBFIELD-ALIGNED)
Provide:
- 3–5 **target_domain_queries** (max 5 words each)
  - MUST strongly reflect **fine_grained_domain** vocabulary and canonical phrases
  - SHOULD be specific enough to appear in titles/abstracts in that subfield
  - SHOULD vary across theoretical/methodological/evaluative angles
